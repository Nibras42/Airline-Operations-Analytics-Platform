This project was cleared by the course staff (R. Acuna) for public release on 5/22/2026.

Keywords: Airline operations, Route demand, Aircraft utilization

Description: This project analyzes U.S. domestic airline operational data to examine how aircraft type and capacity allocation vary across routes with different demand levels. Using the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics Form 41 Traffic dataset (T-100 Domestic Segment), the study focuses on non-stop domestic flight segments and evaluates relationships between passengers transported, available seats, departure frequency, and aircraft type at the route level. Capacity utilization measures, such as load factor, are used as proxies for route performance rather than direct financial profitability, which is not publicly observable. The analysis is restricted to U.S. domestic operations within a recent year to ensure feasibility and consistency, and aims to identify patterns in fleet deployment and capacity management across high-and low-demand routes using publicly available operational data.

Intellectual Merit: The potential for this project is that it can create new knowledge by empirically studying the way that U.S. airlines deploy the type and capacity of aircraft on domestic routes that vary in demand characteristics using publicly available operational data. Although the topic of the way that airlines deploy networks and aircraft has been well-discussed in industry circles, there has been a lack of publicly available transparent study at the route level because of the lack of publicly available financial profitability data. By utilizing capacity utilization ratios such as the load factor as a proxy measure for route profitability, this study allows for the observation of the deployment patterns without the need for publicly unavailable cost and revenue data.

Data Sourcing: The primary data source for this project is obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the United States through the Department of Transportation's TranStats website. The data used for the analysis is the Form 41 Traffic dataset containing the T-100 Domestic Segment data, which contains operational data for U.S. carriers by route, including passenger data, available seats, number of departures made, aircraft types, carrier codes, and the time period. The data is obtained directly from the BTS website by selecting the data for U.S. domestic operations for the last year available. The data is then downloaded in CSV format for analysis. In order to better understand the data for the aircraft types variable, additional data is obtained from the BTS Aviation Support Tables to better understand the aircraft types by mapping the codes for aircraft types to the models of the aircraft. No datasets from Kaggle or any other sources are used for the project. In the absence of route profitability data, which is not publicly available, the load factor is used as a proxy for route profitability.

Background Knowledge: The background knowledge needed for this project will include the knowledge of the processes involved in the planning of airline networks, fleet deployment, as well as capacity management in the aviation industry. Typically, the network of an airline is planned to meet the demand variability, operational constraints, as well as the efficiency of the fleet used in the aviation industry. The fleet deployment of an airline is determined by various factors, such as the distance of the routes, the fuel efficiency of the fleet, as well as the utilization of the fleet. Industry reports by various aviation authorities and aircraft manufacturers will be used to provide the context of the processes involved in the management of demand uncertainty as well as operational constraints in the aviation industry.

Related Work: Prior academic research has examined airline route networks, capacity allocation, and aircraft utilization to better understand airline operational and deployment strategies. Existing studies have shown that passenger demand characteristics influence decisions related to flight frequency, aircraft size selection, and network structure, highlighting tradeoffs between utilization efficiency and network coverage. Other work has analyzed how airlines configure their networks over time in response to demand concentration and operational constraints, demonstrating that aircraft deployment patterns are closely tied to observed route-level demand. This project builds on such research by focusing on route-level operational patterns within U.S. domestic airline networks using publicly available data, without relying on proprietary financial or optimization models.
